Marvel Movies Analysis – Tableau Project

This project explores the relationship between review scores, distributors, characters, and profitability in Marvel movies, using a cleaned dataset and interactive Tableau dashboards.

Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to analyze Marvel movie performance from multiple perspectives including --

Critical Reception – Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic scores

Box Office Results – Opening weekend, North American gross, worldwide gross 

Studios/Distributors – Comparing how different companies’ Marvel films performed

Characters/Franchises – Which characters delivered the best ROI

Key Visualizations:

These visualizations are results of some questions I had?

Opening Weekend vs Rotten Tomatoes – Do critic reviews impact opening box office?

Metacritic vs Rotten Tomatoes – How closely do major critic platforms' employees think?

Average Rotten Tomatoes Score by Distributor – How have newer studios like Disney/Marvel done vs older studios like Fox, Sony, Lionsgate?

Rotten Tomatoes Score Over Time (MCU Phases) – How has Marvel's perceptio changed from early films through the newer MCU phases?

Average ROI by Main Character – Which characters and 'teams' are most profitable?

Insights

The Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic scores are strongly correlated. (R^2 = 0.89). 

The Disney-era Marvel films have consistently higher rated movies than earlier studio efforts.

MCU Phase 1–3 have more consistent ratings, which makes sense with the 4 Avenger Movie releases.

Opening weekend revenue does not have a strong correlation to Rotten Tomatoes (R^2 = 0.06), which makes 
sense because most opening revenue is because of the reputation preceding the movie, not based on the quality of the movie.
